# KeyLogger
In this project i implemented a key logger tool using Python.
This tool has a pretty simple UI to activate it and to find inforamtion in logs.
The user can look for specific data in the log by certain date or values (words/sentences).
The UI implemented using the Tkinter class.

Hope youwll enjoy it :)
